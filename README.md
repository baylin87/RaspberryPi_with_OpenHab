# RaspberryPi_with_OpenHab

## Abstract

During the entire system’s development, it uses the Raspberry 3 Model B (1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53) as the development platform, the official RASPBIAN JESSIE WITH PIXEL operating system as the support, and the Python language to complete the process control. In addition, the system is developed with the help of Internet of Things -- OpenHab as a subsidiary, packaged to the development board, and ultimately the system design can be completed. After the comprehensive test of the system, it shows that the system has a sensitive event perception ability, and it can send feedback to the management in time. So the system is useful for the intelligent management of laboratory.
